COMPONENTS
Create a full-stack web application in a project directory called “carInventory”. Create the back-end of the application using Express and the front-end using React. You should create a MongoDB that stores information about cars in a collection called cars.

TASK
* Create a full-stack web application that interfaces with the iTunes Search API:
* The application should allow the user to:
- Add a car to the cars collection.
- Update information about a single car.
- Update information about more than one car.
- Delete a specific document.
- List all the information for all cars in your database.
- List model, make, registration number, and current owner for all cars older than 5 years.

Application should meet the following criteria:

- It should be a full-stack web application created using React and Express.
- Your code for interfacing with the third-party API (iTunes Search API) should be handled by the back-end of your application.
- The front-end of your application should provide an attractive user interface that allows users to enter search criteria. The user should be able to enter a search term and also select the type of media they want to search for (e.g. movie, podcast, music, audiobook, short film, TV show, software, ebook, or all). The results of the search should be attractively displayed.
- A user should be able to create a list of their favourite content. The user should be able to remove an item from their list of favourites. The list of the user’s favourite content should also be attractively displayed. The list of favourite content need not be remembered when the user navigates away from or leaves your web application.
- The UI should be attractive, easy to use and intuitive.
- You should ensure that your application has been appropriately tested. You should include at least one snapshot test and appropriate unit tests for both the front-end and back-end of the application.
- Use Helmet to help you secure your Express app.
- A code reviewer should be able to launch your app by typing ‘npm start’ from the command line interface.
- The file structure of the project should be well-organised and easy to understand and use.
- Your code should be well documented with appropriate comments. The code should also be easy to read,
- The project should include a file called “readme.md” which includes:
a. An explanation of how to use the app.
b. Clear instructions that an end-user will be able to follow to install, test, and run your app on their local machine.
c. A description of the measures you have taken to ensure the security of this app, including a description of how API keys have been dealt with.
d. A link to the deployed app.
